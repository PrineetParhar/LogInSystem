# LogInSystem
This is a short Log In System script written in C++. This beginner level project really shows the usefulness of File I/O. Enjoy!

Simply, downlaod the available folder and go to your favorite C++ code editor. Run the code (there is no executable for this project so it'll either run the command prompt automatically or you have to copy and paste the code). It should then work! Enjoy!
